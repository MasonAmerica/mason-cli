This directory is complete garbage. It's a half-baked version of Androguard:
https://github.com/androguard/androguard/blob/22849b6965835b611f5fd6615de9301f5f47318e/androguard/core/bytecodes/apk.py.
The reason we can't be civil and use Androguard directly is because their lib packs a ~140 MB punch,
far more than the meager ~15 MBs we've been able to hover around.

Make edits at your own peril.
